I worked on a cardiothoracic unit at the Detroit Medical Center while completing my graduate studies. Upon graduating as a nurse practitioner, I worked in a suburban hospital setting as a hospitalist. It was in this traditional healthcare environment that I began to experience a profound paradigm shift in the way I viewed illness, wellness and the treatment of chronic disease conditions. Because the cornerstone of the nurse practitioner profession is that of health promotion and disease prevention, I soon became disillusioned with the traditional healthcare model and the "pill for every ill" mentality that drives the current healthcare system. I intuitively knew that there was a better way to manage health and promote wellness.\n\nWhile in graduate school, I became a patient in a local Functional Medicine practice in suburban Detroit where I was exposed firsthand to the tenets of Functional Medicine and Anti-Aging Medicine, including an emphasis on healthy lifestyle choices, sound nutrition, daily exercise and stress reduction. I also began bio-identical hormone replacement therapy and understood their value in promoting health, wellness and vitality. I ultimately joined this private practice and have undergone extensive training in both Functional Medicine (Institute for Functional Medicine) and Anti-Aging Medicine (American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine).  I was recruited by Dr. Mark Hyman for the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine and continued to expand upon my experience for four years in both Functional Medicine and Anti-Aging Medicine. I became certified in Functional Medicine in 2017.\n\nOver the last 15 years, my approach to health has always been based on a melding of Functional Medicine and Anti-Aging Medicine, looking for the underlying root cause of disease and assisting patients in being proactive about their health. My understanding of Functional Medicine as unique and personalized allows me to assess all aspects of a patient\'s lifestyle; genetics, environment, emotions, beliefs and social relationships, all of which directly influence health and disease.\n\nI specialize in bio-identical hormone replacement therapy (for both men and women across the health continuum), autoimmune conditions, metabolic syndrome/diabetes, thyroid optimization, anxiety/depression, gut restoration, detoxification (heavy metals, mold exposure), headaches, weight management, chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia.\n\nMy personal interests include public speaking, working with my personal trainer,  and trying to keep up with my three young grandchildren!\nMary\'s Philosophy, Your Experience.\nI believe the most important thing a clinician can do is listen.  Every patient has a story, a series of events in their life that have impacted their health.  No detail is insignificant. Unfortunately, healthcare in our country has become a big business where decisions about your health are all too often left to for-profit insurance companies. Medicine has become impersonal and dismissive, leaving patients lost and hopeless, feeling that symptoms they are experiencing will never improve.\n\nI firmly believe that decisions about your health and wellness are yours and yours alone.  Each patient is respected as an individual. Together as partners, we address the root causes of disease in order to heal the mind, body and spirit rather than simply treating symptoms.  Just treating symptoms is merely a "band-aid" on a bigger problem. My goal is to empower patients and to help them understand that they have ownership in their health and by assuming responsibility, they can heal. I also believe that the human body is an amazing machine. As a clinician and healer, when I set the stage for improvement by taking out what shouldn’t be there (toxins, bad food), and putting back what should be there (vitamins, minerals, hormones), the body heals itself! Before giving up hope that there is a clinician who understands this philosophy of healing, contact our office!',
